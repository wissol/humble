                <h2>Kind Politics</h2>
                <time datetime="2016-10-12">October, the 12th, 2016</time>
                <p class="abstract">
                    How harsh politics can alienate people. Kindness in politics: not something nice but a grave and
                    urgent need.
                </p>
            </header>

            <section>
                <p>
                    I never imagined how hard <q>Brexit</q> would hit me. True, my feelings should be the least of
                    anybody's concern, but let me digress about them for a while as politics affect a myriad of personal
                    stories and my little story will serve as warm introduction to my matter.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I remain, &mdash;yet&mdash;, a member of the Church of England, though I am neither British nor live
                    in Britain. My reason for that, in short, is that I found a haven in a Church of England chaplaincy
                    abroad in a time when I was in a deep religious crisis. Honesty to be served, I have already solved
                    that personal crisis and I was already considering moving to a Spanish speaking church as soon as my
                    term as treasurer would end.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So what has <q>Brexit</q> to do with that? On the level of the <q>newspeak</q> spoken by both camps
                    on the political debate: nothing. But as soon as you scratch that powdered face, you find that this
                    was a struggle for the meaning of Britain, being British and the difference between who is in and
                    who is out. And this was done in a struggle that, &mdash;while mostly peaceful&mdash;, have brought
                    scars in Britain and to a lesser extent, in the rest of the EU. I did not anticipate it would leave
                    a scar on my heart too, but neither I anticipated the strong animadversion of the arguments between
                    the warring parties. My feelings are, of course, of little interest to Britain, but what about the
                    feeling of millions of Britons, on both sides, or even on no side at all? They can't resign
                    themselves to be foreigners and move on. The grudge will remain unless something is done about it.
                    But can it be done without kindness?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Enough on <q>Brexit</q>. I will make my point briefly: we need to distrust on the likes of Trump and
                    abhor his methods. We need to be wary of those who build trenches when no war has begun. We need to
                    introduce kindness in politics. A dreamer, am I? Nay, my position is not that I feel it would be
                    rather pleasant to have kindness in politics. I assert that it is of grave and immediate need.

			<p>
				Not often I find myself stranded without a Bible; though it happens because I rely on the many resources available on the Internet. Even a simple search for the query <em>Bible</em> is enough to find anything I would ever need. Not being neither a Pastor nor a Theologian, I can't speak on their needs, but mine are perfectly supplied. Yet there are times when I'm away of home, smartphone not being smart, cut off from the world.
			</p>

			<p>
				But then there is always the Bible I remember, the words that come to me because I have gone to them over and over again. Those are always there, ready to come to the rescue when needed. I am not going to advocate for going without a Bible, mind you, but to tell you not to worry; if you are one of those who care daily for the Bible, the Bible is becoming part of your soul and will remain with you, alway.

	  		<h2>Slow Bible</h2>
            <time datetime="2016-06-03">June, the 3rd, 2016</time>
	  		<p class="abstract">
	  			The Bible is not meant to be browsed, but read slowly and in prayer with God. The Bible is both God's message and a means by which God transform our lives.
	  		</p>
  		</header>

  		<section>

	  		<p>
	  			Do you browse the Bible as if it were a web page? Then, I would really want you to slow down and take your time, because I believe that is how the Bible is meant to be read.
	  		</p>

	  		<p>
	  			First of all, the Bible is a message of love, courage and hope from God Almighty Himself. The Bible is one of the tools of the Holy Spirit, by which God, transform your attitudes, actions and words. Reading the Bible is fighting the good fight, racing the good race. Each word has a meaning and on each there is a bit of Jesus passion. It is the handbook of saints.
	  		</p>

	  		<p>
	  			Second, the Bible is a book meant to be prayed as much as it is meant to be read. The Bible is a personal conversation between God and you. God, wishing to save you, inspired through the Holy Spirit the words that are written in the Bible. God, out of his own good will, has decided to speak to you, do you want to miss any of his words? No, you slow down and pray, pray to understand the Bible, pray to take it to fruition, but, above all, pray so that you do your part of the conversation with God. Not because God needs it, but because it is his good will and, frankly, because it is you who actually need it.
	  		</p>

	  		<p>
	  			Third, the Bible is a book meant to be shared. Your light has to shine, and carry God's message. And how are you suppose to do that if you just run over the Bible, thinking that you already know everything? That is not the case; that is never the case. Instead, pause and reflect, knowing that you share a responsibility in sharing the Gospel. It is not only the words that you will share, but your actions and, above all, your heart, that will suffer if you just run over God's Words. Remember, this is a treasure, you want to pick up even the last little diamond, so neither you, nor the ones you love will be found in want.
	  		</p>

	  		<p>
	  			In Christ, Amen.

            <time datetime="2016-06-01">June, the 1st, 2016</time>
		  	<p class="abstract">
		  		I have followed all of the conventional wisdom about blogging, and some of the unconventional. This is my declaration of independence from all of that.
		  	</p>
		</header>

		<p>
			This is nothing but a simple blog, on a single page. I've been trying to find the courage to do something like this for ages. Something truly simple without fear of breaking convention or of failure. No, this blog is good enough as it is; it lacks nothing, it is simply OK. I do not need the usual advice that I have been following year after year, sheepishly, even if complaining. No more of that.
		</p>

		<p>
			Every <del>post</del> article on this blog is going to be included on this single page. There is going to be no pesky PHP, no database, no folder structure, no myriad of files, nothing to navigate, no smart SEO fodder. Just a table of contents. No comment system, what for? Write to your pleasure, wherever you feel to. Neither, I would be using any static website generator. A text editor is doing the work fine for me. No calls for action, no share buttons, no statements of copyright or <em>uncopyright</em>, no images unless I do them myself and no promises of doing this blog every single day or thrice a week. I could end it today and, still it would still be <a href="#3">imperfect enough</a>. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I grant myself the right of publishing whenever I please to, even publishing the draft and then amend when necessary, or if I just change my mind. I don't know it all, I know so few, in fact, I could just as well say that I know nothing. Yet, practice seems to help.
		</p>

		<p>
			After years of blogging, this blog is a liberation from everything I've learned, an adventure and a playground.

		  	<h2>Rejoice, pray, give thanks</h2>
            <time datetime="2016-06-01">June, the 1st, 2016</time>
		  	<p class="abstract">
		  		Christ has turned us into creatures of light, and our life should be one of prayer, not being distracted by the world, our even our lack of success. He is walking with us to Heaven.
		  	</p>
		</header>

	  	<figure>
		  	<blockquote>
		  		<p> 
		  			Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.
		  		</p>
		  	</blockquote>

		  	<figcaption>1 Thessalonians 5:16-18</figcaption>		  	

	  	</figure>

	  	<p>
	  		The reason, &mdash;beyond being God's will, as if that would not be reason enough&mdash; is that the apostle has just been writing about the day of the Lord, that triumphant day that will come as a thief of the night, and that, to the redeemed, is the day that will make our hopes true. God, the apostle reminds us, <q>did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ</q>, turning us into creatures of light that would not sleep idly through the night or consumed in vane passions, but, instead, <q>rejoice, pray and give thanks</q>.
	  	</p>

	  	<p>
	  		In fact, it all boils down to praying. Rejoicing and giving thanks are but the kinds of prayers that Thessalonians needed most at their time when Christianity was persecuted. These times, when Christians are ridiculed or ignored, are also times to rejoice, pray and give thanks. The idea is to forsake what we see around and focus on where we are going, where God is leading us, not just showing us the way, but living with us, walking with us, stumbles, falls and all.

		  		We cannot do all that we want to do; not even the essentials. There is barely enough time in a lifetime to master anything. Hence, we must learn to be content with what we actually do.

		</header>

		<p>
			There is, probably, not enough time to do all that we want to do. It might not even be enough time to do the essential, the selected few things we really want to do. Yet, there is nothing wrong with that. We come to this life anew, eager to learn yet not knowing anything. We spend our first years in a feeble attempt to acquire a summary of the knowledge that humankind has built over the course of millenia, and yet we feel frustrated that we cannot learn but the basics of our trade a vague awareness of a few things more by the time we start to work. And yet we only learn as we work, and only if we put our heart into it, year after year, and then, when can consider ourselves masters of our trade it is the time to go, call it retirement, call it death, call it a change of the game.
		</p>

		<p>
			Nowadays the game changes so often than the experience we build must be flexible enough to be applied to some other subject, well enough, at least, to earn yourself a living. I wonder if we will be able to become masters of our trade, at least in the sense of these times that are fading away quickly into a new era. The time is ripe for being happy with imperfection, being content with what we actually do, instead of dreaming for perfection or even regretting what we could have done, but didn't.

	  		<p class='abstract'>
		  		Why we Christians should be speaking about God.
		  	</p>

		</header>

		<p>
			Where I live, we are reaching the point where nobody ever speaks about God any longer. I care because I strongly believe in God with a struggling, but, nevertheless, strong faith that has survived everything it has met, to date. And it is not only that we are no longer speaking about God, it is that, bit by bit, we 	are forgetting what God is about; in other, better words, we are forgetting who God is.
		</p>

		<p>
			I find easier to confront the militant Atheist than this general attitude of not really caring. Yet my faith reminds me of the prophet <q>preaching in the desert</q>, who looks, more than uninspiring, a total lunatic, for he goes whence every body avoids, but then, little by little, words sneak out and the audience goes to him. It could be that this wonder is made possible by the skill or charisma of the prophet, in which case there would be no point in imitating him. But it could be that it worked simply because of the message, because he was faithful to God and it was, ultimately, God who worked the miracle. In that case it would be very reasonable to follow on its path.

		  		I am not selling anything on this blog to be fully free as in freedom of speech. 
		  	</p>

		</header>
	  	
  		<p>
  			I believe that there are far too many blogs trying to sell us something. Often that something is the author. Those authors face the added challenges of attracting readers, guessing what
  			they would like to read, offering exactly that and, on top of all that, selling what they want to sell them. Those authors can fear
  			rejection, because, for them, rejection is failure. If I don't
  			fear rejection, if I don't value my work at how others react to
  			it then I am free, <q>as in free speech</q>.
  		</p>

  		<p>
  			Now, there is nothing wrong with selling, <em>per se</em>,  &mdash;which is my standard, <em>I'm not Communist</em> disclaimer&mdash;. However, I want to be free from those challenges and, instead, focus on telling the truth, forsaking every other concern. Too
  			often, we are reading what we want to read in the sense of listen to what we want to here, be it true or false. Too often,
  			we end up saying what they want to here, and little by little the world is turning into a sort of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVcOYKEdfuc" target="_blank">Oompa-pah</a>. There are millions words on every second yet most of them, <q>mean just exactly what you want to hear</q>. 
  		</p>

  		<p>
			So that's why I'm not seeking profit of any kind on this blog and that's why it's ultra-minimalist form suits it perfectly.

	  	<p>
	  		This is my way to test this whole thing. This is a paragraph, and, as most paragraphs it fits that it would be long. Don't you think? Ese, how you can truly test a paragraph. No, it doesn't need to be overwhelming in size, a couple of whole lines should suffice, or better, five to ten. If this text is enough it should extend for about that number of lines, give or take.

	  	<p>
